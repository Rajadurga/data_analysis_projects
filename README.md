# data_analysis_projects
I have done these projects as a practice for the different data analysis tools (Excel, Python, R, Tableau) that I have learnt.
I have analyzed the data from different sources and derived some conclusions based on the data.
The data sources that I have used are from R tidyverse, kaggle and realtor(https://www.realtor.com/research/data/).
